> _This is a submission for the [Storyblok Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/storyblok)_

## 📖 Overview

**Dagu** is a modern web platform that brings the ancient Afar communication tradition into the digital age. The Afar people of Ethiopia have long relied on **Dagu**, a system of real-time, trusted verbal news sharing. This project revives that spirit by creating a digital space where users can create, share, and engage with valuable community knowledge — called **Habbos**.

The project was built for the Storyblok Challenge to demonstrate how traditional storytelling can thrive on modern headless CMS architecture with a touch of AI.
